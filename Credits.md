There are too many people to credit here, but there are a few persons that have significantly helped :

- The guy who made the Linux version and left symbols in the binaries, allowing me to get pretty much all function names, structs and some variable names and make the disassembly significantly better.
- Clownacy for his uncomplete disassembly from which I copied part of the comments and the labels.
- BLink for his NPC hacking tutorial, as well as his various hacks and his direct help.
- SlighlyIntelligentMonkey for his help and documentation
- Txin for making a CS ASM Guide 
- Carrotlord for his hacking tutorial and the Doukustu Assembler
- Noxid for his assembly compendium, and the 
- Q3 for his function list
- The rest of the community for the moral help and the documentation they gave me.
