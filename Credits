There are too many people to credit here (as this is a community work), but there are a few persons that have significantly helped :

- Clownacy and his uncomplete disassembly from which I copied a great part of the comments and the labels.
- BLink for his NPC hacking tutorial, as well as his various hacks and his direct help.
- Carrotlord for his hacking tutorial
- Noxid for his assembly compendium
- Q3 for his function list
- SlighlyIntelligentMonkey for his help and documentation
- Whoever made the Doukustu Assembler
- Whoever made the Entity List
- An unknown person for making a CS ASM Guide (that is, a file named CS ASM GUIDE (FULL).docx)
- The rest of the community for the moral help and the documentation they gave me.
